To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance from which Polly can successfully throw the javelin to hit the dragon, given the enhancement provided by the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Understanding the Distances:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 1,000 feet.
   - Without any enhancements, Polly can throw the javelin up to a distance of 400 feet.

2. **Effect of the Sapphire Gemstone:**
   - When Polly uses the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance.

3. **Calculate the Enhanced Throwing Distance:**
   - Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, her throwing distance is increased by a factor of three:
     \[
     3 \times 400 = 1,200 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Determine Minimum Safe Distance:**
   - Polly needs to be at a distance greater than the dragon's fire-breathing range to be safe and effectively throw the javelin.
   - The dragon's fire-breathing range is 1,000 feet.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 1,200 feet using the gemstone, which is safely beyond the dragon’s fire-breathing distance of 1,000 feet.
   - Therefore, Polly should stand at the maximum range she can throw with the gemstone, which is 1,200 feet, to safely and effectively hit the dragon.

Final answer: 1200

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sports items Uriah needs to remove in order to achieve a total weight loss of 15 pounds.

### Step 1: Determine the weight of the comic books Uriah removes.
Uriah removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1 1/4 pounds.

1 1/4 pounds can be expressed as a fraction:
\[ 1 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]

Calculate the total weight of 30 comic books:
\[ 30 \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{150}{4} = 37.5 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining weight Uriah needs to remove.
Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing 37.5 pounds worth of comic books, he needs to calculate how much more weight needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 37.5 = -22.5 \]

This result is negative, which indicates that removing 30 comic books already exceeds the required weight loss. Thus, Uriah doesn't need to remove any sports items to achieve the goal of reducing 15 pounds.

### Step 3: Conclusion.
The question is a bit misleading because Uriah has already exceeded the weight loss goal by removing the comic books alone. Therefore, the number of sports items he needs to remove is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]
-------------------
-------------------
ERROR: Failed to extract final answer from chain:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds Uriah needs to remove and then figure out how many sports items he should remove after removing some comic books.

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - Uriah needs to reduce the weight of his books by 15 pounds.
   - Comic books weigh \( \frac{3}{4} \) pounds each.
   - Sports items weigh \( \frac{5}{7} \) pounds each.

2. **Determine the Initial Reduction from Comic Books:**
   - Uriah plans to remove 30 comic books.
   - Calculate the total weight reduction from comic books:
     \[
     30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{3}{4} \text{ pounds/comic book} = \frac{90}{4} = 22.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - After removing 30 comic books, Uriah has already reduced more than the required 15 pounds, as 22.5 pounds is more than 15 pounds.

3. **Determine the Excess Reduction:**
   - Since 22.5 pounds exceeds the 15-pound requirement, Uriah has surpassed his goal by:
     \[
     22.5 \text{ pounds} - 15 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - This means that Uriah doesn't actually need to remove any sports items because he has already achieved the goal with just the comic books.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Uriah does not need to remove any sports items because removing 30 comic books already exceeds the required 15-pound reduction.

The final answer is 0.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much water is left after accounting for the water that each child has. We begin by understanding the initial conditions and the amounts involved:

1. **Initial Water Quantity:**
   - We start with a total of 24 liters of water.

2. **Water Taken by the Two Girls:**
   - Each girl takes an equal portion of the water.
   - Together they take 8 parts (4 parts each, since "otunaotu" implies equal division).
   - Thus, the fraction of water taken by the two girls is 8 parts out of a total of 8 parts plus the boy's 6 parts, which equals 14 parts in total. So, the girls take \( \frac{8}{14} \) of the total water.

3. **Water Taken by the Boy:**
   - The boy takes 6 parts out of the total 14 parts.
   - Thus, the fraction of water taken by the boy is \( \frac{6}{14} \).

4. **Calculate the Amount of Water Taken:**
   - Total water taken by the girls: \( \frac{8}{14} \times 24 \) liters.
   - Total water taken by the boy: \( \frac{6}{14} \times 24 \) liters.

5. **Determine the Actual Amounts:**
   - Water taken by the girls: \( \frac{8}{14} \times 24 = \frac{192}{14} = 13.714 \) liters.
   - Water taken by the boy: \( \frac{6}{14} \times 24 = \frac{144}{14} = 10.286 \) liters.

6. **Calculate Total Water Taken:**
   - Total water taken by all children is \( 13.714 + 10.286 = 24 \) liters.

7. **Calculate Remaining Water:**
   - Since 24 liters were taken out of the initial 24 liters, no water is left.

By following these steps, we find that the remaining amount of water is:

0

To solve this problem, let's represent the number of copies sold by Harald as \( x \).

According to the problem, Egwu Marilyn sold ten times the number of copies that Harald sold. This can be expressed as \( 10x \).

Together, the total number of copies sold by both Egwu Marilyn and Harald is 88,000 copies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 10x = 88,000 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 11x = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ x = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

To solve this problem, let's break down the information and follow the steps:

1. **Determine the total number of potted plants Mary has:**
   - Mary received 18 new potted plants.
   - She already had 2 potted plants.

   Total number of potted plants = 18 (new) + 2 (existing) = 20 plants.

2. **Determine the number of pots Mary plans to give away:**
   - Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 pots.

3. **Calculate the total number of potted plants she gives away:**
   - Since she gives away 1 plant per pot from the 40 pots, she will give away 40 plants in total.

4. **Calculate the number of potted plants remaining with Mary:**
   - Total plants initially = 20
   - Total plants given away = 40

   Since Mary only has 20 potted plants, she can only give away 20 plants, not the 40 she plans. Thus, after giving away all her 20 potted plants, she will have:

   Plants remaining = 20 (initial) - 20 (given away) = 0 plants.

The final answer is 0.

To solve this problem, let's go through the information step by step:

1. Yesterday, Mary received 18 potted plants.
2. She already had 2 potted plants at home.
3. The total number of potted plants she has is the sum of the new plants and the ones she already had:
   - Total plants = 18 (new) + 2 (existing) = 20 potted plants.
4. Mary plans to give away one potted plant from each pot to her friends and family.
5. Since she has 20 potted plants, she will give away 1 plant for each of the 20 pots.
6. Therefore, Mary gives away 20 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants remain with Mary, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she initially has:

- Remaining plants = Total plants - Plants given away
- Remaining plants = 20 - 20 = 0

Therefore, the number of potted plants remaining with Mary is 0.

To find out the profit Sasha will make, we'll calculate the cost of the remaining lumber and the revenue from selling them. The difference between the revenue and the cost will give us the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the remaining lumber.**

1. Calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber:
   - Sasha has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber.
   - The cost per piece is $10.
   - Total cost = Number of pieces × Cost per piece = \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

2. Calculate the cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber:
   - Sasha has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber.
   - The cost per piece is $16.
   - Total cost = Number of pieces × Cost per piece = \(5 \times 16 = 80\).

3. Total cost for all lumber:
   - Total cost = Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber + Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber = \(100 + 80 = 180\).

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the lumber.**

1. Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber:
   - Sasha has 10 pieces.
   - She bought them for $10 each, and there's no mention of a selling price increase, so assume she sells them for the same price.
   - Revenue = Number of pieces × Selling price per piece = \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

2. Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber:
   - Sasha has 5 pieces.
   - She bought them for $16 each, and similarly, assume she sells them for the same price.
   - Revenue = Number of pieces × Selling price per piece = \(5 \times 16 = 80\).

3. Total revenue from selling all lumber:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 lumber + Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 lumber = \(100 + 80 = 180\).

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

Profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \(180 - 180 = 0\).

Thus, the profit Sasha will make from selling all the remaining lumber is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]

To find out how many spoons were in the pack that Julia bought, we can break down the problem into the following logical steps:

1. Determine the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband gave her five new packs: Julia ended up with a total of 12 spoons after using 3 spoons for tasting. Therefore, the number of spoons she had after the tasting is \(12 + 3 = 15\).

2. Calculate the number of spoons Julia's husband gave her: Julia’s husband bought five new packs of spoons and gave them to her. We do not know the number of spoons in each pack, but we know that all these spoons were added to Julia's collection. 

3. Calculate how many spoons Julia had initially from the pack she bought: Let \(x\) be the number of spoons in the pack Julia bought. When she used 3 spoons for tasting, she was left with \(x - 3\) spoons from her own pack. 

4. Establish the relationship between the spoons: After receiving spoons from her husband, she had a total of 15 spoons. If we denote the number of spoons in each of the five packs as \(y\), then \(5y + (x - 3) = 15\).

5. Solve for the number of spoons in Julia's pack: If we assume each pack contains the same number of spoons, we can further simplify the problem by considering a reasonable assumption or known value for \(y\) based on typical packaging. However, since we are given no additional specific information, we can assume some typical values or that Julia's pack initially contained all the spoons before her husband’s contribution.

6. Since the problem is constructed in a way that the only missing number is from Julia's pack, we can conclude the difference before and after her husband’s contribution: Since before receiving her husband's packs, she had 0 spoons and after receiving them and using 3, she had 12, we can conclude her pack was empty or irrelevant to the final count. The important information here is inferred that the number of spoons in her pack must have been large or insignificant enough to ignore given the total was immediately derived post her husband’s contribution.

So, if we assume each of the five packs from the husband contained equal spoons, and she has 12 after using 3, she had 15 initially, which are all from those 5 packs.

Therefore, the logical conclusion here is that the pack Julia bought initially contained the same variable amount as her husband's, which becomes irrelevant without a specific count provided. So, the spoons in her initial purchase, by elimination and the structure provided, is \(x = 0\) or undefined. Given Julia's counting was based post contribution, you would logically conclude the initial pack was not counted or was empty.

Thus, the problem indirectly suggests the final correctly interpreted answer, based on the construction, is her contribution was not counted, hence \(x = 0\) without specific pack information.

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: 
   - Joseph spent $500 in the month of May.
   - In June, his expenditure increased by $60 compared to May.

2. **Calculate June's Expenditure**:
   - Since Joseph spent $500 in May, and in June he spent $60 more than that, we need to add $60 to May's expenditure.
   - June's expenditure = May's expenditure + $60 = $500 + $60.

3. **Compute June's Expenditure**:
   - June's expenditure = $500 + $60 = $560.

4. **Calculate Total Expenditure for May and June**:
   - To find the total expenditure for the two months, we add the expenditure of May and June.
   - Total expenditure = May's expenditure + June's expenditure = $500 + $560.

1. **Understand the setup**: 
   - John has 10 hectares of pumpkin farm.
   - Each hectare contains 100 pumpkins.

2. **Calculate the total number of pumpkins on the farm**:
   - Since there are 100 pumpkins per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pumpkins is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pumpkins/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pumpkins}
     \]

3. **Understand the harvesting schedule**:
   - John harvests his pumpkins every 3 months.

4. **Determine the number of harvests in one year**:
   - There are 12 months in a year.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times John will harvest his cashew plantation in a year, and how many cashew nuts he will harvest each time.

1. **Determine the total number of cashew nuts per hectare:**
   - John has 10 hectares of cashew plantation.
   - There are 100 cashew nuts per hectare.

   Therefore, the total number of cashew nuts for the entire plantation is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total cashew nuts} = 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ cashew nuts per hectare} = 1000 \text{ cashew nuts}
   \]

2. **Determine the frequency of harvests in a year:**
   - John harvests his cashew plantation every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.

   To find out how many times he will harvest in a year, we divide the total months in a year by the number of months between each harvest:

   \text{Number of harvests per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months per harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests per year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cashew nuts harvested in a year:**
   - Each harvest yields 1000 cashew nuts (from step 1).
   - John harvests 4 times a year (from step 2).

   Therefore, the total number of cashew nuts harvested in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Total cashew nuts per year} = 1000 \text{ cashew nuts per harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ cashew nuts}
   \]

So, the final answer is 4000.

To solve the problem, we'll break down the information given and perform calculations step-by-step.

1. **Initial Blocks:**
   Johnny has a box of Lego blocks with 500 pieces. This is our starting point.

2. **Additional Blocks:**
   We are told he has another batch of blocks that is three times the number of the first batch (500 pieces).
   \[
   \text{Additional blocks} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]

3. **Fractional Blocks:**
   Johnny also has blocks that are one-fourth the total number of blocks mentioned so far. To find this, we need to first calculate the current total number of blocks:
   \[
   \text{Current total} = 500 + 1500 = 2000
   \]
   Now, calculate one-fourth of this current total:
   \[
   \text{Fractional blocks} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2000 = 500
   \]

4. **Total Blocks:**
   Finally, add all the blocks together to get the total number of Lego blocks Johnny has:
   \[
   \text{Total blocks} = 500 + 1500 + 500 = 2500
   \]

Thus, the total number of Lego blocks Johnny has is 2500. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2500}
\]

ERROR: Failed to extract final answer from chain:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lego blocks Johnny has by adding up the blocks in each separate box.

1. **First box**: Johnny has a box with 500 lego pieces. Therefore, the first box contributes 500 pieces to the total count.

2. **Second box**: The second box contains three times the number of pieces in the first box. Since the first box has 500 pieces, the second box will have:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
   So, the second box contributes 1500 pieces.

3. **Third box**: The third box contains one quarter of the total number of lego pieces. Let's denote the total number of lego pieces as \( x \). According to the problem, the third box contains \(\frac{1}{4}\) of \( x \), or:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of lego blocks, \( x \), by setting up the equation based on the information given:

\[
x = 500 + 1500 + \frac{x}{4}
\]

To solve for \( x \), first, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 4:

\[
4x = 4 \times 500 + 4 \times 1500 + x
\]

\[
4x = 2000 + 6000 + x
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4x = 8000 + x
\]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):

\[
4x - x = 8000
\]

\[
3x = 8000
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{8000}{3} = 2666.67
\]

This result reveals that my initial assumption in setting up the equation does not directly resolve to a whole number, which suggests a need to verify the constraints. Let's assume the third box was not meant to form part of the whole at the beginning until later, then treat the three boxes separately as such:

By resolving it, Johnny accumulates the lego separately in the third box as \(\frac{1}{4}\) of what he initially has before combining them. Hence, without further mathematical adjustment, the count remains with the boxes before, and the third box complements post-calculation separately, initially considered erroneous.

Reassessing the sum:
Thus, the logical conclusion from a corrected understanding would be:
\[
x = 500 + 1500
\]

Finally, Johnny chitaara a total of:

\[
2000
\] 

Hence, the number of lego blocks Johnny finally collected is 2000.

ERROR: Failed to extract final answer from chain:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. **Identify the Pieces in the First Box**: 
   - Johnny has a box with 500 pieces of lego. This is straightforward, as it is directly given in the problem.

2. **Determine the Pieces in the Second Box**: 
   - The second box contains lego pieces that are three times the amount in the first box. 
   - Since the first box has 500 pieces, the second box will have \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.

3. **Determine the Pieces in the Third Box**: 
   - The third box has one-fourth (1/4) of the total number of lego pieces.
   - Let's first find the total number of pieces in the first and second boxes combined: 
     \[
     500 + 1500 = 2000
     \]
   - The third box has one-fourth of the total number of pieces after considering the first and second boxes.
     \[
     \text{One-fourth of } 2000 = \frac{2000}{4} = 500
     \]
   - Therefore, the third box contains 500 pieces.

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Pieces**:
   - Now, add the number of pieces from all three boxes together to find the total number of lego pieces Johnny has.
   - Total pieces = Pieces in the first box + Pieces in the second box + Pieces in the third box
   - Total pieces = \(500 + 1500 + 500 = 2500\)

Based on these steps, the final computed answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bananas the zoo manager should buy to sustain the animals for two months. We have three types of animals with different banana requirements per month:

1. Monkeys (enwe) require 200 bananas per month.
2. Gorillas (adaka) require 400 bananas per month.
3. Baboons (utobo) require 100 bananas per month.

First, calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of animal per month:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month

Next, calculate the total number of bananas needed for all the animals for one month by summing up the bananas required for each type of animal:

Total bananas per month = Bananas for monkeys + Bananas for gorillas + Bananas for baboons
Total bananas per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zoo manager is buying bananas for two months, multiply the total monthly requirement by 2:

Total bananas for two months = Total bananas per month × 2
Total bananas for two months = 700 × 2 = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zoo manager should buy 1400 bananas to sustain the animals for two months.

5. **Convert the total time back to minutes if needed:**
   - Since the original question does not specify the need to convert back into minutes, the answer in seconds is acceptable.

Therefore, the total time Billy will take to prepare the cucumbers is 5700 seconds.

The final answer is 5700.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number three times as often as another number on a six-sided die, and express that probability as a percentage.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand the Possible Outcomes:**
   - A standard six-sided die has outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Clarify the Problem:**
   - We want to find the probability that Jerry rolls a number (let's call this number \( x \)) three times as often as another number (let's call this number \( y \)).

3. **Probability of Each Outcome:**
   - Since the die is fair, each of the six numbers has an equal probability of being rolled. Thus, \( P(x) = P(y) = \frac{1}{6} \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - We need \( P(x) = 3 \times P(y) \).

5. **Calculate the Probability Under This Condition:**
   - If \( P(x) = 3 \times P(y) \), then \( \frac{1}{6} = 3 \times \frac{1}{6} \), which is not possible under fair die conditions. Each number has an equal chance of being rolled, and it cannot be inherently more probable than another in a single roll without changing the die's fairness.

6. **Reinterpretation:**
   - If we consider multiple rolls and frequency of outcomes, the probability of rolling a number a specific number of times in multiple trials can follow a binomial distribution, but the question suggests a single roll scenario.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Given a single roll of a fair die, no number can inherently be three times as likely as another with equal rolls. Thus, the probability of rolling one number being three times more frequent than another in a single roll is logically 0.

Finally, express this probability as a percentage:
- Probability = 0, as no number can be three times more frequent than another in one roll of a fair die.

Therefore, the final answer is:
0

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used after distributing them to all the restaurants.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Total Amount of Carrots:**
   - We are given that there are two pounds of carrots available for distribution.

2. **Identify the Total Number of Restaurants:**
   - There are 41 restaurants in total.

3. **Determine the Distribution Requirement:**
   - Each restaurant is supposed to receive two pounds of carrots.

4. **Calculate the Total Amount of Carrots Needed:**
   - Since each restaurant receives two pounds of carrots, for 41 restaurants, the total amount of carrots needed is:
     \[
     41 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 82 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Compare Total Carrots Available with Total Carrots Needed:**
   - You have only two pounds of carrots available, but you need 82 pounds to give each restaurant two pounds.

6. **Determine the Unused Carrots:**
   - Since the amount of carrots available (2 pounds) is less than the amount needed (82 pounds), technically, all the available carrots will be distributed, and you will not meet the requirement.
   - Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots not used is \(0\) because you don't have enough to meet the 82-pound requirement, but all 2 pounds you have will be used.

Hence, the final answer is:
\[
0

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Mark earns per week in cents. Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Understand the payment structure:**
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence.

2. **Calculate Publisher B's rate:**
   - Publisher B's rate per sentence = 2 * Publisher A's rate = 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.

3. **Determine the total number of sentences edited:**
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

4. **Introduce variables for the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of sentences edited for Publisher A.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of sentences edited for Publisher B.

5. **Formulate an equation based on the total sentences:**
   - Since the total number of sentences edited is 1000, we have:
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]

6. **Formulate an equation based on the earnings:**
   - Total earnings from Publisher A = \( 5x \) cents.
   - Total earnings from Publisher B = \( 10y \) cents.
   - We need to calculate the total earnings, which is the sum of earnings from both publishers.

7. **Express total earnings:**
   - Total earnings each week = \( 5x + 10y \) cents.

8. **Solve for total earnings:**
   - From the equation \( x + y = 1000 \), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 1000 - x \) into the earnings equation:
     \[
     5x + 10(1000 - x) = 5x + 10000 - 10x = 10000 - 5x
     \]

9. **Maximize the earnings.**
   - Simplify \( 10000 - 5x \) to find that the total earnings are dependent on \( x \).
   - However, direct calculation isn't necessary since we are asked for the total earnings, which is a function of \( x \) and \( y \).

10. **Calculate specific earnings:**
    - Consider that Publisher A pays less, so Mark might edit more sentences for Publisher B.
    - But since the problem does not specify, we calculate based on the earnings equation:
    - Substitute \( x = 400 \) (as an example, assuming he balances the work) and \( y = 600 \):
    - Total earnings = \( 5(400) + 10(600) = 2000 + 6000 = 8000 \).

Thus, Mark earns a total of 8000 cents per week.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Mark earns per week from editing sentences for two different publishers, A and B. Here are the steps to find the solution:

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Payments:**
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays Mark double what Publisher A pays per sentence.

2. **Calculate the Payment from Publisher A:**
   - Let the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A be \( x \).
   - The payment from Publisher A is \( 5x \) cents.

3. **Calculate the Payment from Publisher B:**
   - Since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B is \( 1000 - x \).
   - Publisher B pays double the rate of Publisher A, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.
   - The payment from Publisher B is \( 10(1000 - x) \) cents.

4. **Calculate Total Weekly Payment:**
   - Total payment is the sum of payments from both publishers:
   \[
   \text{Total Payment} = 5x + 10(1000 - x)
   \]
   - Simplify the expression:
   \[
   = 5x + 10000 - 10x
   \]
   \[
   = 10000 - 5x
   \]

5. **Determine the Distribution of Sentences:**
   - To find the specific number of sentences edited for each publisher, we need additional information or assumptions, otherwise, we assume that the problem's main goal is to determine the total payment given any value of \( x \).

6. **Assuming Equal Distribution for Simplicity (if not specified otherwise):**
   - If not otherwise stated, assume Mark edits half the sentences for each publisher, \( x = 500 \) (this is for illustrative purposes, as the exact distribution isn't provided).

7. **Calculate Total Payment with \( x = 500 \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 500 \) into the equation:
   \[
   = 10000 - 5(500)
   \]
   \[
   = 10000 - 2500
   \]
   \[
   = 7500
   \]

Thus, Mark earns a total of 7500 cents per week.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, which contains both chocolates and candy apples.

1. **Determine the weight of each type of candy:**
   - We know that each chocolate weighs 40 grams.
   - Each chocolate is twice as heavy as a candy apple. Therefore, the weight of each candy apple is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) grams.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the chocolates:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolates.
   - Total weight of chocolates = Number of chocolates × Weight per chocolate
   - Total weight of chocolates = \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \) grams

3. **Calculate the total weight of the candy apples:**
   - Joe has 18 candy apples.
   - Total weight of candy apples = Number of candy apples × Weight per candy apple
   - Total weight of candy apples = \( 18 \times 20 = 360 \) grams

4. **Calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:**
   - Total weight = Total weight of chocolates + Total weight of candy apples

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of all the candies Joe has in his bag. We know two things:

1. Joe has 25 chocolates.
2. Joe has 18 candy apples.
3. Each chocolate weighs 40 grams.
4. Each chocolate is twice as heavy as a candy apple.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

**Step 1: Determine the weight of one candy apple.**

Since each chocolate is twice as heavy as each candy apple, and each chocolate weighs 40 grams, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Weight of one chocolate} = 2 \times \text{Weight of one candy apple} \]

\[ 40 = 2 \times \text{Weight of one candy apple} \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for the weight of one candy apple:

\[ \text{Weight of one candy apple} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the chocolates.**

Joe has 25 chocolates, and each chocolate weighs 40 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the chocolates is:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the candy apples.**

Joe has 18 candy apples, and each candy apple weighs 20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the candy apples is:

\[ 18 \times 20 = 360 \text{ grams} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total weight of all the candies in the bag.**

To find the total weight of all the candies, we add the total weight of the chocolates to the total weight of the candy apples:

\[ 1000 + 360 = 1360 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the bag of candies is 1360 grams. 

**Final Answer:**

1360

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the candies (chocolates and candy apples) Joe has in grams. We know the following from the problem:

1. Joe has 25 chocolates and 18 candy apples.
2. Each chocolate weighs 40 grams.
3. Each chocolate is twice as heavy as each candy apple.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the weight of one candy apple.**

The problem states that each chocolate is twice as heavy as each candy apple. If each chocolate weighs 40 grams, then each candy apple weighs half of that:

Weight of one candy apple = 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of all the chocolates.**

Joe has 25 chocolates, and each chocolate weighs 40 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the chocolates is:

Total weight of chocolates = 25 chocolates × 40 grams/chocolate = 1000 grams.

**Step 3: Calculate the total weight of all the candy apples.**

Joe has 18 candy apples, and each candy apple weighs 20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the candy apples is:

Total weight of candy apples = 18 candy apples × 20 grams/candy apple = 360 grams.

**Step 4: Calculate the total weight of all the candies.**

The total weight of all the candies is the sum of the total weight of the chocolates and the total weight of the candy apples:

Total weight of all candies = Total weight of chocolates + Total weight of candy apples
Total weight of all candies = 1000 grams + 360 grams = 1360 grams.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 1360.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day.

1. **Understand the Information:**
   - On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
   - On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day.
   - On the third day, the total number of customers over the three days is 150.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the first day.
   - From the problem, \( x = 100 \).

   - On the second day, she counted 50 more than on the first day: 
     \[
     y = x + 50
     \]
     Since \( x = 100 \), then \( y = 100 + 50 = 150 \).

   - On the third day, let the number of customers be \( z \).

3. **Use Total Customers Equation:**
   - The total number of customers over the three days is given as 150:
     \[
     x + y + z = 150
     \]

4. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - We know \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 150 \), so substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     100 + 150 + z = 150
     \]

5. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     250 + z = 150
     \]
   - Subtract 250 from both sides:
     \[
     z = 150 - 250
     \]
     \[
     z = -100
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculation shows a logical inconsistency as the number of customers cannot be negative. Re-evaluate the problem parameters:
     - Likely, the problem was misinterpreted or there might be missing information. Verify the initial conditions or seek clarification. 

As it stands, the solution based on the given parameters seems incorrect due to the logical error. The expected answer should be 0 based on the interpretation that the net customers on the third day are zero to balance the equation, but this seems counterintuitive given the problem's context.

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Janeth will repay over 12 months, given that she borrowed $2000 at an interest rate of 10% and is making monthly payments of $165.

1. **Understand the Loan Details:**
   - Principal amount (initial loan): $2000
   - Annual interest rate: 10%
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Duration: 12 months

2. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid Over 12 Months:**
   - Janeth makes monthly payments of $165.
   - Over 12 months, the total payment is calculated by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of months:
     \[
     \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 = 1980
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Interest Paid:**
   - Since the total amount paid over 12 months is $1980 and the original loan amount was $2000, we can see that Janeth is paying less than the amount she borrowed. This implies that the monthly payment of $165 and the total payments do not account for the interest on the loan properly, assuming a standard amortizing loan.
   
   However, given that the problem asks for the total amount Janeth will repay and given that the monthly payments are fixed at $165, we use this as provided:
   \[
   \text{Total repaid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980
   \]

4. **Determine the Shortfall or Overpayment:**
   - Since $1980 is less than the borrowed $2000, this indicates a misunderstanding or miscommunication in the problem statement, as typically with a 10% interest rate, the total repayment over 12 months should exceed the original principal.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only way the numbers can be made to align is if the $165 monthly payment was a mistake in the question context, or if the interest was calculated or structured in a non-standard way.
   - Without additional clarification, based on the given monthly payment, the total repayment amount is $1980.

Therefore, the total amount Janeth will repay over the 12-month period, based on the monthly payment given, is \( \boxed{1980} \).

   - Difference in cookies eaten = Total cookies eaten by Sue - Total cookies eaten by her sister
   - Difference = \( 46 - 18 = 28 \) cookies

4. **Convert Difference in Cookies to Calories:**

   - We are given that each cookie contains 200 calories.
   - Therefore, the difference in calories = Difference in cookies \(\times\) Calories per cookie
   - Difference in calories = \( 28 \times 200 = 5600 \) calories

**Final Answer:**

5600

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more cookies Sue ate compared to her sister on both Monday and Tuesday and then convert those extra cookies into calories.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate:**
   - On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
   - On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.

2. **Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

3. **Find the difference in the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister each day:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate \(20 - 5 = 15\) more cookies than her sister.
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate \(26 - 13 = 13\) more cookies than her sister.

4. **Calculate the total number of extra cookies Sue ate over the two days:**
   - Total extra cookies = \(15 + 13 = 28\).

5. **Convert the extra cookies into calories:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories, so the total extra calories Sue consumed compared to her sister is \(28 \times 200 = 5600\).

The final numerical answer is 5600.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister, follow these logical steps:

1. **Determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday:**
   - Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.

2. **Calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Monday:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
   - Therefore, Sue ate 4 times 5 cookies = 20 cookies on Monday.

3. **Determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate on Tuesday:**
   - Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.

4. **Calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister.
   - Therefore, Sue ate 2 times 13 cookies = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

5. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate:**
   - Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

6. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate:**
   - Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Total cookies Sue's sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

7. **Calculate the difference in the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister:**
   - Difference = Sue's total cookies - Sister's total cookies
   - Difference = 46 cookies - 18 cookies = 28 cookies

8. **Calculate the calorie difference:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Therefore, the calorie difference = 28 cookies × 200 calories per cookie = 5600 calories.

So, the final computed answer is 5600.

Let's go through the problem step by step to find the solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister.
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
   - Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Each cookie contains 200 calories.
   - We need to find out how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister.

2. **Calculating Cookies Eaten by Sue:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times the cookies her sister did. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate:
     \[
     4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}
     \]
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times the cookies her sister did. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate:
     \[
     2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Calculating Total Cookies Eaten:**
   - Total cookies eaten by Sue:
     \[
     20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies}
     \]
   - Total cookies eaten by her sister:
     \[
     5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Difference in Cookies:**
   - Difference in cookies eaten by Sue and her sister:
     \[
     46 - 18 = 28 \text{ cookies}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Difference in Calories:**
   - Since each cookie is 200 calories, the calorie difference is:
     \[
     28 \times 200 = 5600 \text{ calories}
     \]

The final answer is the difference in calories consumed by Sue compared to her sister, which is 5600.
