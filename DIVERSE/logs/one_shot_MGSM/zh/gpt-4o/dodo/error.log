Problem 2: 乔希决定试试房屋翻新。他花了 80,000 美元买了一套房子，然后投入 50,000 美元进行维修。这样做使房子的价值增加了 150%。他赚了多少利润？
Reasoning step: [['To determine the profit Josh made from the house renovation, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Costs:**\n   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000\n   - Cost of repairs: $50,000\n   - Total initial investment = Purchase price + Cost of repairs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n2. **Increase in Value:**\n   - The value of the house increased by 150%.\n   - To find the new value, calculate the increase in value and add it to the initial investment:\n   - Increase in value = 150% of $130,000 = 1.5 × $130,000 = $195,000\n\n3. **New Value of the House:**\n   - New value = Initial investment + Increase in value = $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000\n\n4. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - Profit = New value - Total initial investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000\n\nThe profit Josh made from the house renovation is 195000.']]

Reasoning step: [['To find out how many cups of feed Wendy needs to give her chickens during the last meal of the day, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Daily Feed Per Chicken:**\n   - Wendy feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal.\n   - She feeds the chickens 3 meals a day.\n   - Therefore, each chicken receives \\(3 \\text{ cups/meal} \\times 3 \\text{ meals/day} = 9 \\text{ cups/chicken/day}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Daily Feed for the Entire Flock:**\n   - Wendy has 20 chickens.\n   - The total feed needed for all chickens in a day is \\(20 \\text{ chickens} \\times 9 \\text{ cups/chicken/day} = 180 \\text{ cups/day}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Amount Already Fed:**\n   - In the morning, Wendy feeds the chickens 15 cups.\n   - In the afternoon, she feeds them 25 cups.\n   - The total amount of feed given by the end of the afternoon is \\(15 \\text{ cups} + 25 \\text{ cups} = 40 \\text{ cups}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Remaining Feed Needed for the Last Meal:**\n   - The total daily feed requirement for the flock is 180 cups.\n   - So, the remaining feed needed for the last meal is \\(180 \\text{ cups} - 40 \\text{ cups} = 140 \\text{ cups}\\).\n\nTherefore, Wendy needs to give the chickens 140 cups of feed during the last meal of the day.

Problem 245: 一个水族箱里有 4 只蜗牛，另一个水族箱里有 32 只蜗牛。这两个水族箱里的蜗牛数量之差是两个水族箱里鱼数量的两倍。如果两个水族箱里鱼的数量相同，每个水族箱里有多少条鱼？
Reasoning step: [["To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium, given that the number of snails in each aquarium and the relationship between the number of snails and fish.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the number of snails in each tank:**\n   - The first tank has 4 snails.\n   - The second tank has 32 snails.\n\n2. **Find the difference in the number of snails between the two tanks:**\n   \\[\n   32 - 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate the difference in the number of snails to the number of fish:**\n   We know from the problem statement that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the number of fish in each tank. Let's denote the number of fish in each tank as \\( x \\).\n\n   According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the number of fish:\n   \\[\n   28 = 2x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the number of fish:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{28}{2} = 14\n   \\]\n\nSo, each aquarium has 14 fish. The final answer is:\n\\[\n14\n\\]"]]
