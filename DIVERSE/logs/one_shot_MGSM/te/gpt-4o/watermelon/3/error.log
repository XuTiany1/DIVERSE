Reasoning step: [['To determine how many years it takes for Carlos to start making a profit from planting a lemon tree, we need to calculate his costs and revenues over the years.\n\n1. **Initial Cost**: Carlos spends $90 to plant the lemon tree.\n\n2. **Annual Costs**: He spends $3 each year for watering and fertilizing the tree.\n\n3. **Annual Revenue**: The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and he sells each lemon for $1.5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \\text{ lemons} \\times \\$1.5/\\text{lemon} = \\$10.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Net Profit per Year**: Each year, his net profit is the annual revenue minus the annual costs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit per Year} = \\$10.5 - \\$3 = \\$7.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Break-even Calculation**: Carlos needs to recover the initial cost of $90 using the net profit per year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Years to Break-even} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Cost}}{\\text{Net Profit per Year}} = \\frac{\\$90}{\\$7.5} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

Reasoning step: [['To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag is $20.\n\n2. **Number of Increments**: Since the price increases every two months, we first need to calculate how many 2-month periods fit into 36 months.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{2} = 18\n   \\]\n   So, there are 18 increments.\n\n3. **Price Increase Formula**: The price increases by 20% each increment.

However, since the problem asks for the number of mice per cage directly:\n- We must conclude that the problem was meant to illustrate the number of hamsters only and not directly calculate the mice without further data.\n\nThus, the number of mice per cage remains undetermined with the information. But if we assume equal distribution per the structure, it's a logical inconsistency in problem setup unless more data is provided.\n\nThe final answer based on the logical flow and assumptions: \\( x \\) remains unspecified due to missing data on total hay used for mice."], ["To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps and use the given information to find out how many rats are in each cage.\n\n1. **Understanding the Variables:**\n   - We have rats distributed in 3 cages.\n   - Each rat receives 6 strands of hay.\n   - There are 10 separate cages for mice, each getting 5 strands of hay.\n   - Rabbits are in separate cages and receive 20 strands of hay.\n   - 160 strands of hay are distributed among the mice.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Mice:**\n   - Since each mouse receives 5 strands of hay, and there are 10 cages, the number of mice can be calculated by dividing the total strands of hay by the number of strands each mouse receives.\n   - Total hay used by mice = 160 strands.\n   - Number of mice = Total hay used by mice / Hay per mouse = 160 / 5 = 32 mice.\n\n3. **Rat Distribution:**\n   - Since the problem states that rats are in 3 cages and each rat gets 6 strands of hay, we need to find out the total number of rats.\n   - Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \\( x \\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of rats is \\( 3x \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Hay for Rats:**\n   - The total number of strands used by the rats can be calculated as: \\( 3x \\times 6 \\).\n\n5. **Using the Information Provided:**\n   - Since all the hay is used only by rats, mice, and rabbits, and no other use is mentioned, we can assume that the problem is asking us to focus on the distribution among rats specifically.\n   - However, without additional information about the total hay used for the rabbits or the total hay available, we are limited to using the information concerning the mice and rats only.\n\n6. **Solving for Each Cage of Rats:**\n   - Since we only have information on the total hay given to the mice, and nothing is specified about the rabbits or total hay, we can assume that the problem is asking for only the distribution of hay among the rats given that part of the problem.\n   - Given that all the hay is accounted for by the problem's constraints and setup, and no other figures are provided, we estimate the solution based on the given distribution.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nEach cage of rats contains \\( x \\) rats, where \\( x \\) is the number of rats per cage, given that \\( 3x \\times 6 \\) accounts for the distribution of hay. Since no specific total hay distribution was provided, the solution of rats per cage remains contingent on the setup but is likely consistent with the problem's constraints. If additional numbers were provided, we could finalize \\( x \\) precisely. However, given the constraints, the logical solution based on equal distribution and provided data is \\( x = 8 \\) rats per cage."], ["To solve this problem, let's follow the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the setup:**\n   - There are 3 cages with rats.\n   - Each rat receives 6 blades of grass.\n   - There are 10 cages with mice.\n   - Each mouse receives 5 blades of grass.\n   - The total number of blades of grass distributed among the mice is 160.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of mice:**\n   - Since the total number of blades of grass given to the mice is 160 and each mouse gets 5 blades, we can find out the total number of mice by dividing the total blades of grass by the number each receives.\n   - Number of mice = Total blades for mice / Blades per mouse = 160 / 5 = 32.\n\n3. **Distribute mice evenly across cages:**\n   - The 32 mice are placed evenly in 10 cages.\n   - To find the number of mice per cage, divide the total number of mice by the number of cages.\n   - Mice per cage = Total number of mice / Number of cages = 32 / 10 = 3.2.\n\nSince the problem likely expects an integer number of animals per cage and since the situation of having a non-integer value suggests that the problem might have intended for the mice to be distributed differently, let’s verify the integer distribution: \n\n- It's possible that there was a mistake in distribution, but with the direct calculation, each cage should have 3.2 mice, which doesn't make sense in practical terms without more context on how the distribution is handled or rounded.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate based on typical distribution logic (since 3.2 isn't feasible):**\n   - Given the setup, it's logical that there might be a rounding or grouping assumption not explicitly described.\n   - Assume the closest integer is accepted for practical purposes, so rounding to 3 mice per cage might be intended if not otherwise specified.\n\nThus, based on calculations and reasonable assumptions about distribution in such problems, each cage would have approximately:\n\n3 mice."]]

Therefore, we need to subtract this amount from the initial amount to find out how much water is left in the tank after she has used some:\n\n   Initial water in the tank = 120 liters\n   Water used by Celina = 90 liters\n\n   Remaining water in the tank = Initial water - Water used\n                               = 120 liters - 90 liters\n                               = 30 liters\n\n3. After using 90 liters, Celina is left with 30 liters of water in the tank.\n\n4. According to the problem, she was able to collect double the remaining amount of water as rainwater. This means she collected twice the remaining amount of water after using it for her garden:\n\n   Amount of rainwater collected = 2 * Remaining water\n                                 = 2 * 30 liters\n                                 = 60 liters\n\n5. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the remaining water and the collected rainwater:\n\n   Total water in the tank = Remaining water + Rainwater collected\n                           = 30 liters + 60 liters\n                           = 90 liters\n\nTherefore, the final numerical answer for the amount of water now in the tank is 90."]]
