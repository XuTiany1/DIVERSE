However, we can infer that the second stop is just before finishing the trip.\n\n6. **Calculate Distance Traveled Between Stops:**\n   - Since the second stop occurs right before the trip ends (15 minutes before finishing), it implies that after his second stop, Henry continues to complete the trip, which means he travels the remaining distance, which is negligible since it's very close to the end.\n   - Therefore, the significant distance traveled between the first and second stops is the bulk of the remaining trip after the first stop, which is the remaining trip distance before the final leg of the trip.\n   - Given that the second stop happens very close to the end and the trip is essentially completed after that stop, we can assume the distance between the first and second stops encompasses most of the remaining trip after the first stop.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Subtract the small remaining distance after the second stop from the 40 miles left after the first stop.

Therefore, at his first stop, he has completed 20 miles of his trip.\n\n3. **Distance Remaining After First Stop**: Since the total trip is 60 miles and he has already traveled 20 miles, the remaining distance after the first stop is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ miles} - 20 \\text{ miles} = 40 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Second Stop**: Henry stops for the second time 15 minutes before completing his entire trip.

Therefore, the second stop occurs shortly before the conclusion of the 60-mile trip.\n\n6. **Miles Traveled Between Stops**: To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stop, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop (at 20 miles) to the point shortly before he completes the trip.

We can calculate the number of blue tiles (B) he purchased using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of blue tiles}}{\\text{Cost per blue tile}} = \\frac{200}{40} = 5\n   \\]\n\n   So, John purchased 5 blue tiles.\n\n2. **Determine the number of red tiles purchased:**\n\n   The problem states that John purchased twice as many red tiles as blue tiles. Therefore, the number of red tiles (R) he purchased is:\n\n   \\[\n   R = 2 \\times B = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n   So, John purchased 10 red tiles.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of each red tile:**\n\n   The cost of each red tile is 50% more than the cost of each blue tile. Since each blue tile costs $40, the cost of each red tile is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of each red tile} = 40 + (0.5 \\times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n   So, each red tile costs $60.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost for the red tiles:**\n\n   With 10 red tiles purchased and each costing $60, the total cost for the red tiles is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of red tiles} = R \\times \\text{Cost per red tile} = 10 \\times 60 = 600\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost for all tiles:**\n\n   Finally, we calculate the total amount John spent on all the tiles by adding the total cost of the blue tiles and the total cost of the red tiles:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total cost of blue tiles} + \\text{Total cost of red tiles} = 200 + 600 = 800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spent on the tiles is \\( \\boxed{800} \\)."], ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost John incurred for purchasing both red and blue tiles.

We know that 1 mile = 5280 feet, so 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.\n4. Steve rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute.\n5. The time it takes for Steve to reach home is distance divided by speed: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for Steve} = \\frac{15840 \\text{ feet}}{440 \\text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate for Tim:\n\n1.

However, since the problem asks for the number of mice per cage directly:\n- We must conclude that the problem was meant to illustrate the number of hamsters only and not directly calculate the mice without further data.\n\nThus, the number of mice per cage remains undetermined with the information. But if we assume equal distribution per the structure, it's a logical inconsistency in problem setup unless more data is provided.\n\nThe final answer based on the logical flow and assumptions: \\( x \\) remains unspecified due to missing data on total hay used for mice."], ["To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps and use the given information to find out how many rats are in each cage.\n\n1. **Understanding the Variables:**\n   - We have rats distributed in 3 cages.\n   - Each rat receives 6 strands of hay.\n   - There are 10 separate cages for mice, each getting 5 strands of hay.\n   - Rabbits are in separate cages and receive 20 strands of hay.\n   - 160 strands of hay are distributed among the mice.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Mice:**\n   - Since each mouse receives 5 strands of hay, and there are 10 cages, the number of mice can be calculated by dividing the total strands of hay by the number of strands each mouse receives.\n   - Total hay used by mice = 160 strands.\n   - Number of mice = Total hay used by mice / Hay per mouse = 160 / 5 = 32 mice.\n\n3. **Rat Distribution:**\n   - Since the problem states that rats are in 3 cages and each rat gets 6 strands of hay, we need to find out the total number of rats.\n   - Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \\( x \\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of rats is \\( 3x \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Hay for Rats:**\n   - The total number of strands used by the rats can be calculated as: \\( 3x \\times 6 \\).\n\n5. **Using the Information Provided:**\n   - Since all the hay is used only by rats, mice, and rabbits, and no other use is mentioned, we can assume that the problem is asking us to focus on the distribution among rats specifically.\n   - However, without additional information about the total hay used for the rabbits or the total hay available, we are limited to using the information concerning the mice and rats only.\n\n6. **Solving for Each Cage of Rats:**\n   - Since we only have information on the total hay given to the mice, and nothing is specified about the rabbits or total hay, we can assume that the problem is asking for only the distribution of hay among the rats given that part of the problem.\n   - Given that all the hay is accounted for by the problem's constraints and setup, and no other figures are provided, we estimate the solution based on the given distribution.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nEach cage of rats contains \\( x \\) rats, where \\( x \\) is the number of rats per cage, given that \\( 3x \\times 6 \\) accounts for the distribution of hay.
