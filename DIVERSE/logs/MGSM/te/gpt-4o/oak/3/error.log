To determine how far he has traveled by the second stop, we need to consider the entire journey of 60 miles, and calculate how much distance is left to complete after the second stop.\n\n5. **Calculate the Distance Left After the Second Stop**: Since the second stop occurs 15 minutes before the end of the trip and he finishes the trip by completing a total of 60 miles, we assume he resumes his trip after the second stop and completes the remaining distance in those 15 minutes.\n\n6. **Determine the Distance Between Stops**: If Henry finishes the remaining part of his trip immediately after his second stop, this means that the distance left to complete after his second stop is covered in the last 15 minutes.

A total of 160 hay stalks are distributed among the mice.\n   - Rabbits: Not given specific numbers, but each rabbit receives 20 hay stalks.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Little Mice:**\n   - Since 160 hay stalks are distributed among the little mice, and each gets 5 stalks:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of little mice} = \\frac{160}{5} = 32\n     \\]\n   - These 32 mice are distributed across 10 cages.

There are some rabbit cages, and each rabbit receives 20 blades of grass.\n4. A total of 160 blades of grass are distributed among the small mice.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many small mice there are in total. The total amount of grass given to the small mice is 160 blades, with each small mouse receiving 5 blades. To find the total number of small mice, we divide the total number of blades by the number of blades each small mouse receives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{160 \\text{ blades}}{5 \\text{ blades per small mouse}} = 32 \\text{ small mice} \\]\n\nNow, we know there are 32 small mice distributed across 10 cages.

Let's denote the number of mice per cage as \\( x \\).\n\nEach mouse gets 6 blades of grass, so each cage receives:\n\n\\[ 6x \\text{ blades of grass per cage} \\]\n\nSince there are 3 cages, the total number of blades distributed to the mice in these cages is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 6x = 18x \\text{ blades of grass} \\]\n\nWe don't have information directly connecting this distribution to the 160 blades given to the small mice, but let's assume there was a misinterpretation. If the focus is on these cages:\n\nSince the small mice distribution isn't directly impacting the main problem, the main question likely wants us to focus on the main cages distribution and determine \\( x \\).\n\nWithout further clarification, let's focus:\n\nIf we have been given the detail of 160 blades for small mice but are to solve for the main cage mice distribution, and find how many per cage:\n\nWe return to solve for \\( x \\) as if the small mice detail was a misdirect or separate:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{18x}{3 \\times 6} = 10 \\]\n\nThus, there are 10 mice per cage in the main set of 3 cages."]]

Mary is two years younger than Joan.\n2. Mary is five years older than Jessa.\n3. Jessa is 20 years old.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine Mary's Age:**\n   - We know that Mary is five years older than Jessa. Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mary's age} = \\text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Joan's Age:**\n   - We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. This means Joan is two years older than Mary. Since we have already calculated Mary's age as 25, we can find Joan's age:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Joan's age} = \\text{Mary's age} + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of Ages:**\n   - Now that we have determined the ages of all three girls, we can calculate the total sum of their ages. Add the ages of Joan, Mary, and Jessa together:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total age} = \\text{Joan's age} + \\text{Mary's age} + \\text{Jessa's age} = 27 + 25 + 20\n     \\]\n\nPerforming the addition gives us:\n\\[ \n27 + 25 = 52 \n\\]\n\\[ \n52 + 20 = 72 \n\\]\n\nThus, the total sum of the ages of the three girls is 72."]]

Reasoning step: [["To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the changes in the number of French fries Griffith has, based on the actions of the other characters.\n\n1. **Initial Situation:**\n   - Griffith starts with 24 French fries.\n\n2. **Kylie Takes Fries:**\n   - Kylie takes 5 fries from Griffith.\n   - Remaining fries with Griffith = 24 - 5 = 19 fries.\n\n3. **Billy and Kelly's Fries:**\n   - It is stated that Billy took double the fries Kelly took, but we don't have direct values here yet.\n\n4. **Ginger Gives Fries to Griffith:**\n   - Let's assume Ginger gives Griffith 'G' fries.\n\n5. **Calbay Takes Fries:**\n   - Calbay takes 3 fries less than what Kylie took.\n   - Since Kylie took 5 fries, Calbay takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffith.\n\n6. **Final Count with Griffith:**\n   - After all these transactions, Griffith ends up with 27 fries.\n\nUsing this information, let's calculate how many fries Ginger gave to Griffith.\n\n- After Kylie takes 5 fries, Griffith has 19 fries.\n- Calbay takes 2 fries, leaving Griffith with 19 - 2 = 17 fries.\n- Let G be the number of fries Ginger gives to Griffith.\n- After receiving G fries from Ginger, Griffith ends up with 27 fries.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\\[ 17 + G = 27 \\]\n\nSolving for G:\n\\[ G = 27 - 17 \\]\n\\[ G = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffith 10 fries.

Since Kylie took 5 fries, Billy takes:\n   - 5 * 2 = 10 fries.\n   - Fries left with Griffith = 19 - 10 = 9.\n\n4. Ginger gives a handful of fries back to Griffith.
