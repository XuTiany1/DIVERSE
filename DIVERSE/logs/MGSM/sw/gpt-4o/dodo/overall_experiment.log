Iwapo Melanie amesalia na visafishaji 5 vya kuvuta uchafu, alianza na vingapi?
Reasoning step: [['To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie initially had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided and solve it step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of vacuum cleaners.\n\n2. According to the problem, Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house. Therefore, the number sold to the green house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. She sold 2 more to the red house. Therefore, the number sold to the red house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} + 2\n   \\]\n\n4. She then sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners to the orange house. To calculate the remaining vacuum cleaners after the first two sales:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining after green and red house sales} = x - \\left(\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{x}{3} + 2\\right) = x - \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = \\frac{x}{3} - 2\n   \\]\n\n5. She sold half of what was remaining to the orange house:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{3} - 2\\right)\n   \\]\n   Thus, the number sold to the orange house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{6} - 1\n   \\]\n\n6. After these sales, she is left with 5 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the equation for the remaining vacuum cleaners is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\left(\\frac{x}{6} - 1\\right) = 5\n   \\]\n\n7. Now, solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{x}{6} + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - \\frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n8.

Problem 62: Mercy akifanya kazi katika kampuni moja kwa miaka 40, atapata malipo ya uzeeni ya kila mwaka ya $50,000 kwa mwaka. Kuanzia baada ya miaka 20, anakuwa na haki ya kupata 5% ya thamani ya malipo ya uzeeni kila mwaka. Akiacha kazi baada ya miaka 30, malipo yake ya uzeeni ya kila mwaka yatakuwa ngapi?
Reasoning step: [["To determine Mercy's annual retirement payment if she leaves after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Retirement Payment Structure:**\n   - Mercy is entitled to a full annual retirement payment of $50,000 if she works for 40 years.\n   - After 20 years, she accrues 5% of the full retirement payment for each additional year she works.\n\n2. **Calculate the Accrued Percentage After 30 Years:**\n   - She works for 30 years, which is 10 years beyond the initial 20 years.\n   - Each year beyond the 20th year earns her an additional 5% of the full retirement payment.\n   - Therefore, the percentage accrued after 30 years is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Additional years} = 30 - 20 = 10 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accrued percentage} = 10 \\times 5\\% = 50\\%\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Percentage of the Retirement Payment:**\n   - After 30 years, she accrues 50% of the full retirement payment.\n   - Thus, her annual retirement payment is 50% of $50,000.\n\n4. **Calculate the Annual Retirement Payment:**\n   - The annual retirement payment is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{50}{100} \\times 50,000 = 25,000\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, if Mercy leaves the company after 30 years, her annual retirement payment will be $25,000.

Problem 153: Dave alinunua kifurushi kikubwa cha chipsi na akala kumi na nne kabla ya shakwe aliye na njaa kuiba kifurushi hicho kutoka kwa mkono wake. Shakwe huyo alipotua, aligooka nusu ya chipsi ambazo Dave alikuwa amekula. Kisha njiwa watatu wakamfurusha kutoka kwa chakula hicho, na kila njiwa akala chipsi tatu. Baadaye, rakuni aliiba theluthi mbili ya chipsi zilizosalia. Siafu wakabeba chipsi ya mwisho, na kuacha tano nyuma. Kulikuwa na chipsi ngapi katika kifurushi hicho wakati Dave alikinunua?
Reasoning step: [["Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the initial number of chips in the package.\n\n1. **Dave Eats Chips:**\n   - Dave initially eats 14 chips.\n\n2. **Shakwe Steals and Eats:**\n   - Shakwe eats half of what Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 chips, shakwe eats 7 chips (half of 14).\n\n3. **Chips Remaining After Shakwe:**\n   - After shakwe eats 7 chips, 14 - 7 = 7 chips remain.\n\n4. **Pigeons Eat:**\n   - Three pigeons arrive, and each eats 3 chips. Therefore, they eat a total of 3 * 3 = 9 chips.\n\n5. **Chips Remaining After Pigeons:**\n   - After the pigeons eat, 7 - 9 = -2 chips, which indicates a discrepancy. The proper interpretation is that initially there must have been enough chips for the pigeons to eat, meaning the remaining chips were more than calculated.\n\nLet's reassess from the beginning assuming unknown initial chips `x`:\n\n- Dave eats 14 chips.\n- Shakwe steals and eats 7 chips (half of 14).\n- Therefore, after shakwe, 14 - 7 = 7 chips remain.\n- Pigeons eat 9 chips total, suggesting at least 9 chips must have been there, so there were initially more than 7 chips after shakwe's action.\n\n6. **Correct Chips Remaining After Pigeons:**\n   - Since after pigeons there needed to be enough chips, we assume pigeons eat 9 chips from the remaining `y` after shakwe's action.\n   - If pigeons eat 9 chips, then `y` (post-shakwe chips) must be at least 9.\n   - The initial assumption needs correction: the stepwise understanding of each action must ensure non-negative remaining chips after pigeons.\n\n7. **Calculate Forward Based on Final Condition:**\n   - Let's consider the final step provided: only 5 chips remain after the sequence of actions.\n   - Before final step of ants taking one chip and leaving 5: \n     - Assume `z` chips after pigeons (before raccoon): `z` chips' exact number cannot be deduced from negative after pigeon assumption.\n     - Raccoon steals 2/3 of chips before ants: if 5 left, then raccoons left 5 after stealing 2/3.\n     - Let raccoon leaves 1/3, implying 3 * 5 = 15 chips prior to raccoon.\n     - Therefore, before raccoon, there must be 15 chips.\n\n8. **Reconcile with Pigeon's Eating:**\n   - Since we previously had a negative assumption, let’s consider pigeon correctly: from prior logical consistency, post-shakwe should leave enough to correct to 15 after pigeons:\n     - Pre-pigeon should be 15 + 9 = 24 to satisfy pigeon and raccoon sequence coordination.\n     - Prior to shakwe, let `x - 14 = 24`, the initial chips count `x = 24 + 14`.\n\nTherefore, the correct initial number of chips Dave purchased is 39."]]

Reasoning step: [["To find out the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we'll break it down by the days of the week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.\n\n1. **Determine the weekly schedule:**\n   - **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:** Kimo has 3 classes each day, with each class lasting 1 hour.\n     - Total hours per day on these days = 3 classes × 1 hour = 3 hours\n     - Total hours per week for these days = 3 days × 3 hours = 9 hours\n\n   - **Tuesday and Thursday:** Kimo has 2 classes each day, with each class lasting 2 hours.\n     - Total hours per day on these days = 2 classes × 2 hours = 4 hours\n     - Total hours per week for these days = 2 days × 4 hours = 8 hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total weekly hours:**\n   - Total hours per week = 9 hours (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) + 8 hours (Tuesday, Thursday) = 17 hours\n\n3. **Calculate the total hours for the semester:**\n   - There are 16 weeks in the semester.\n   - Total hours in the semester = 17 hours/week × 16 weeks = 272 hours\n\nThus, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

Reasoning step: [["To determine how much time Mike spends writing letters each week, let's break down the information provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Friends**: Mike initially had 5 friends.\n\n2. **Current Number of Friends**: Mike stopped being friends with 2 of them, so he now has \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) friends.\n\n3. **Letters Sent per Friend per Week**: Mike exchanges 2 letters per week with each of his friends.\n\n4. **Total Letters per Week**: Since he has 3 friends, he sends \\(3 \\text{ friends} \\times 2 \\text{ letters per friend} = 6\\) letters per week.\n\n5. **Length of Each Letter**: Each letter is 5 pages long.\n\n6. **Total Pages per Week**: Therefore, in total, he writes \\(6 \\text{ letters} \\times 5 \\text{ pages per letter} = 30\\) pages per week.\n\n7. **Time to Write Each Page**: Mike takes 6 minutes to write one page.\n\n8. **Total Time per Week in Minutes**: To find out how many minutes he spends writing, multiply the number of pages by the time per page: \\(30 \\text{ pages} \\times 6 \\text{ minutes per page} = 180\\) minutes.\n\n9. **Convert Minutes to Hours**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, convert the total minutes to hours: \\(\\frac{180 \\text{ minutes}}{60} = 3\\) hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week. The final answer is: 3"]]

Problem 243: Jason ana mpango wa simu wa dakika 1000 kila mwezi. Kila siku anapiga simu kwa dakika 15 akiongea na mdosi wake, na ameongea kwa simu dakika 300 na watu wengine mwezi huu. Jason bado amesalia na dakika ngapi ikiwa mwezi huu una siku 30?
Reasoning step: [['To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total minutes used with his boss:**\n   - Jason calls his boss for 15 minutes every day.\n   - The month has 30 days.\n   - Total minutes with boss = 15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes.\n\n2. **Determine the total minutes used with other people:**\n   - Jason has talked for 300 minutes with other people.\n\n3. **Calculate the total minutes used:**\n   - Total minutes used = Minutes with boss + Minutes with others\n   - Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.\n\n4. **Determine the total minutes available in his plan:**\n   - Jason has a plan of 1000 minutes per month.\n\n5. **Calculate the remaining minutes:**\n   - Remaining minutes = Total plan minutes - Total minutes used\n   - Remaining minutes = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes remaining in his plan for the month. The final answer is 250.']]

Problem 244: Griffin alikuwa na chipsi 24, lakini Kyle alichukua 5. Billy alichukua mara mbili zaidi ya Kyle. Ginger alimpa Griffin chipsi kadhaa, na kisha Colby akachukua kutoka kwa Griffin chipsi 3 chini ya zile ambazo Kyle alikuwa amechukua. Ikiwa mwishoni Griffin alikuwa na chipsi 27, Ginger alimpa Griffin chipsi ngapi?
Reasoning step: [["Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Situation**: Griffin starts with 24 chips.\n\n2. **Kyle's Action**: Kyle takes 5 chips from Griffin.\n   - Griffin now has \\( 24 - 5 = 19 \\) chips.\n\n3. **Billy's Action**: Billy takes twice as many chips as Kyle did.\n   - Billy takes \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) chips.\n   - Griffin now has \\( 19 - 10 = 9 \\) chips.\n\n4. **Colby's Action**: Colby takes 3 chips less than Kyle did.\n   - Colby takes \\( 5 - 3 = 2 \\) chips.\n   - Before Colby takes chips, Ginger must have given Griffin some chips because Griffin ends with 27 chips which needs to be calculated.\n   - Let's denote the number of chips Ginger gave Griffin as \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Calculating Ginger's Contribution**:\n   - After Billy's action, Griffin had 9 chips.\n   - Ginger gives \\( x \\) chips, so Griffin now has \\( 9 + x \\) chips.\n   - Colby takes 2 chips, so Griffin now has \\( 9 + x - 2 = x + 7 \\) chips.\n\n6. **Final Situation**:\n   - Griffin ends up with 27 chips.\n   - Therefore, \\( x + 7 = 27 \\).\n\n7. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - \\( x + 7 = 27 \\)\n   - Subtract 7 from both sides: \\( x = 27 - 7 = 20 \\)\n\nThe number of chips Ginger gave Griffin is 20. \n\nFinal answer: 20"]]

Problem 245: Kuna konokono 4 katika tangisamaki na konokono 32 katika tangisamaki nyingine. Tofauti kati ya idadi ya konokono katika tangisamaki hizi mbili ni mara mbili zaidi ya idadi ya samaki katika tangisamaki zote mbili. Ikiwa tangisamaki zote mbili zina idadi sawa ya samaki, kuna samaki wangapi katika kila tangisamaki?
Reasoning step: [['To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fish in each tangisamaki (fish tank), given the conditions provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Given Information:**\n   - There are 4 snails in the first tangisamaki.\n   - There are 32 snails in the second tangisamaki.\n   - The difference in the number of snails between the two tangisamaki is twice the total number of fish in both tangisamaki.\n   - Both tangisamaki have the same number of fish.\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in the Number of Snails:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate the Difference in Snails to the Number of Fish:**\n   - The condition states that the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of fish in each tangisamaki.\n   - Therefore, the total number of fish in both tangisamaki is \\( 2x \\).\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation Based on the Condition:**\n   \\[\n   28 = 2 \\times (2x)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   28 = 4x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{28}{4} = 7\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 7 fish in each tangisamaki.\n\nThe final answer is 7.']]
