Problem 2: Josha anaamua kujaribu kununua nyumba na kuuza kwa faida. Ananunua nyumba kwa $80,000 na kutumia $50,000 kuikarabati. Hii iliongeza thamani ya nyumba hiyo kwa 150%. Alipata faida ya kiasi gani?
Reasoning step: [["To determine the profit Josha made from buying and selling the house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Investment:**\n   Josha's total investment is the sum of the purchase price and the renovation costs.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Investment} = \\text{Purchase Price} + \\text{Renovation Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Increased Value of the House:**\n   The renovation increased the house's value by 150%.

Problem 12: Carlos anapanda mlimau. Mti huo utagharimu $90 kuupanda. Kila mwaka utazaa limau 7, anazoweza kuuza kwa $1.5 kila moja. Gharama ya kunyunyiza maji na kulisha mti huo kila mwaka ni $3. Itachukua miaka mingapi kabla ya yeye kuanza kupata mapato kutoka kwa mlimau huo?
Reasoning step: [['To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the yearly net income and then find when the initial cost is recovered.\n\n1. **Initial Cost of Planting the Tree:**\n   - The cost to plant the tree is $90.\n\n2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons:**\n   - Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.\n   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.\n   - Annual revenue = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.\n\n3. **Annual Maintenance Cost:**\n   - The yearly cost for watering and feeding the tree is $3.\n\n4. **Annual Net Income:**\n   - Net income = Annual revenue - Annual maintenance cost\n   - Net income = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5/year.\n\n5. **Calculating the Break-Even Point:**\n   - Carlos needs to recover the initial planting cost of $90.\n   - To find out how many years it takes to recover this cost:\n   - Break-even point = Initial cost / Annual net income\n   - Break-even point = $90 / $7.5/year = 12 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts making a profit from the lemon tree. The final answer is 12.']]

Problem 13: Melanie ni mfanyabiashara wa nyumba kwa nyumba. Aliuza theluthi moja ya visafishaji vyake vya kuvuta uchafu katika nyumba ya kijani, 2 zaidi kwa nyumba nyekundu, na nusu ya vilivyosalia katika nyumba ya rangi ya chungwa. Iwapo Melanie amesalia na visafishaji 5 vya kuvuta uchafu, alianza na vingapi?
Reasoning step: [['To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie initially had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided and solve it step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of vacuum cleaners.\n\n2. According to the problem, Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house. Therefore, the number sold to the green house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. She sold 2 more to the red house. Therefore, the number sold to the red house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} + 2\n   \\]\n\n4. She then sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners to the orange house. To calculate the remaining vacuum cleaners after the first two sales:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining after green and red house sales} = x - \\left(\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{x}{3} + 2\\right) = x - \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = \\frac{x}{3} - 2\n   \\]\n\n5. She sold half of what was remaining to the orange house:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{3} - 2\\right)\n   \\]\n   Thus, the number sold to the orange house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{6} - 1\n   \\]\n\n6. After these sales, she is left with 5 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the equation for the remaining vacuum cleaners is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\left(\\frac{x}{6} - 1\\right) = 5\n   \\]\n\n7. Now, solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{x}{6} + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - \\frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n8. Find a common denominator for the fractions (which is 6):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2x}{6} - \\frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n9. Combine the fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n10. Add 1 to both sides:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{x}{6} = 6\n    \\]\n\n11. Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for \\( x \\):\n    \\[\n    x = 36\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, Melanie initially had 36 vacuum cleaners. The final answer is 36.']]

Therefore:\n     \\[\n     Q + C + W = 700\n     \\]\n   - The number of child bees is three times the number of queen bees:\n     \\[\n     C = 3Q\n     \\]\n   - The number of worker bees is twice the number of child bees:\n     \\[\n     W = 2C\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve the Equations:**\n   - Substitute \\( C = 3Q \\) into \\( W = 2C \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 2(3Q) = 6Q\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( C = 3Q \\) and \\( W = 6Q \\) into the total equation:\n     \\[\n     Q + 3Q + 6Q = 700\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     10Q = 700\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( Q \\):\n     \\[\n     Q = \\frac{700}{10} = 70\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Number of Worker Bees:**\n   - Now that we know \\( Q = 70 \\), find \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     C = 3Q = 3 \\times 70 = 210\n     \\]\n   - Find \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 6Q = 6 \\times 70 = 420\n     \\]\n\nThe number of worker bees is 420.

Problem 147: Debra anafuatilia mzinga wa nyuki ili kuona ni nyuki wangapi huingia na kutoka kwa siku. Huwa anaona nyuki 30 wakiondoka kwenye mzinga katika saa 6 za kwanza, na kisha kuona 1/2 ya idadi hio ya nyuki wakirejea katika saa 6 zinazofuata. Anaona mara mbili zaidi ya nyuki aliowaona wakiondoka mara ya kwanza wakiruka wakitoka kwenye mzinga na kutoka katika saa 6 zinazofuata. Kisha kila nyuki aliyeondoka kabla ya hapo anarudi katika saa 6 zinazofuata. Debra aliona nyuki wangapi wakirudi kwenye mzinga katika saa 6 za mwisho za siku?
Reasoning step: [["To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **First 6 hours:**\n   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.\n\n2. **Next 6 hours:**\n   - During these hours, half of the bees that left earlier return. Since 30 bees left, half of them are \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) bees. \n   - Therefore, 15 bees return during these 6 hours.\n\n3. **Third set of 6 hours:**\n   - During these hours, Debra observes twice the number of bees that initially left, leaving the hive again. Initially, 30 bees left, so twice this number is \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) bees. \n   - Thus, 60 bees leave during these 6 hours.\n\n4. **Last 6 hours:**\n   - During these final 6 hours, every bee that has left previously returns. \n   - This includes the 60 bees that left in the third set of 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the number of bees returning to the hive during the last 6 hours is 60.\n\nThe final answer is 60."]]

Problem 153: Dave alinunua kifurushi kikubwa cha chipsi na akala kumi na nne kabla ya shakwe aliye na njaa kuiba kifurushi hicho kutoka kwa mkono wake. Shakwe huyo alipotua, aligooka nusu ya chipsi ambazo Dave alikuwa amekula. Kisha njiwa watatu wakamfurusha kutoka kwa chakula hicho, na kila njiwa akala chipsi tatu. Baadaye, rakuni aliiba theluthi mbili ya chipsi zilizosalia. Siafu wakabeba chipsi ya mwisho, na kuacha tano nyuma. Kulikuwa na chipsi ngapi katika kifurushi hicho wakati Dave alikinunua?
Reasoning step: [["Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the initial number of chips in the package.\n\n1. **Dave Eats Chips:**\n   - Dave initially eats 14 chips.\n\n2. **Shakwe Steals and Eats:**\n   - Shakwe eats half of what Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 chips, shakwe eats 7 chips (half of 14).\n\n3. **Chips Remaining After Shakwe:**\n   - After shakwe eats 7 chips, 14 - 7 = 7 chips remain.\n\n4. **Pigeons Eat:**\n   - Three pigeons arrive, and each eats 3 chips. Therefore, they eat a total of 3 * 3 = 9 chips.\n\n5. **Chips Remaining After Pigeons:**\n   - After the pigeons eat, 7 - 9 = -2 chips, which indicates a discrepancy. The proper interpretation is that initially there must have been enough chips for the pigeons to eat, meaning the remaining chips were more than calculated.\n\nLet's reassess from the beginning assuming unknown initial chips `x`:\n\n- Dave eats 14 chips.\n- Shakwe steals and eats 7 chips (half of 14).\n- Therefore, after shakwe, 14 - 7 = 7 chips remain.\n- Pigeons eat 9 chips total, suggesting at least 9 chips must have been there, so there were initially more than 7 chips after shakwe's action.\n\n6. **Correct Chips Remaining After Pigeons:**\n   - Since after pigeons there needed to be enough chips, we assume pigeons eat 9 chips from the remaining `y` after shakwe's action.\n   - If pigeons eat 9 chips, then `y` (post-shakwe chips) must be at least 9.\n   - The initial assumption needs correction: the stepwise understanding of each action must ensure non-negative remaining chips after pigeons.\n\n7. **Calculate Forward Based on Final Condition:**\n   - Let's consider the final step provided: only 5 chips remain after the sequence of actions.\n   - Before final step of ants taking one chip and leaving 5: \n     - Assume `z` chips after pigeons (before raccoon): `z` chips' exact number cannot be deduced from negative after pigeon assumption.\n     - Raccoon steals 2/3 of chips before ants: if 5 left, then raccoons left 5 after stealing 2/3.\n     - Let raccoon leaves 1/3, implying 3 * 5 = 15 chips prior to raccoon.\n     - Therefore, before raccoon, there must be 15 chips.\n\n8. **Reconcile with Pigeon's Eating:**\n   - Since we previously had a negative assumption, let’s consider pigeon correctly: from prior logical consistency, post-shakwe should leave enough to correct to 15 after pigeons:\n     - Pre-pigeon should be 15 + 9 = 24 to satisfy pigeon and raccoon sequence coordination.\n     - Prior to shakwe, let `x - 14 = 24`, the initial chips count `x = 24 + 14`.\n\nTherefore, the correct initial number of chips Dave purchased is 39."]]

Problem 236: Ram hutumia kalamu nyingi. Aligundua kuwa anaweza kuokoa pesa kwa kuchanganya wino kutoka kwa kalamu tano zilizo tupu ili kutengeneza kalamu moja. Akinunua kalamu 25 na kisha akazitumia kutengeneza kalamu mpya wino ukipungua, atakuwa na kalamu ngapi kwa jumla?
Reasoning step: [['To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many new pens Ram can create by combining ink from used pens, and then determine the total number of pens he will have in the end.\n\n1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.\n\n2. **Using the Pens**: Once Ram uses these 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.\n\n3. **Combining Ink**: According to the problem, Ram can make one new pen from the ink of 5 empty pens.\n   - Number of new pens that can be made from 25 empty pens:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{25 \\text{ empty pens}}{5 \\text{ empty pens per new pen}} = 5 \\text{ new pens}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Pens**: After creating new pens, Ram will have the original pens plus the new ones created:\n   - Initially, he had 25 pens.\n   - He creates 5 new pens from the empty ones.\n   - Total number of pens:\n     \\[\n     25 + 5 = 30\n     \\]\n\nThus, Ram will have a total of 30 pens in the end. The final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]']]

Problem 246: Msanii wa mapambo wa Jean hutoza $250 kila saa. Anahitaji mapambo ghali mno kwa filamu anayofanya na huwa inachukua saa 6 kufanya kila siku na anahitaji ifanywe mara 4 kwa wiki. Filamu hiyo inachukua wiki 5 kukamilisha. Baada ya filamu hiyo kuisha msanii wa mapambo humpa Jean kipunguzo cha 10% kwa sababu ya kiwango cha kazi alichofanya. Jean alimlipa pesa ngapi?
Reasoning step: [['To determine the total amount Jean paid, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of hours Jean works per week**:\n   - Jean works 6 hours per day.\n   - She works 4 days per week.\n   \n   Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week\n\n2. **Calculate the number of hours Jean works over 5 weeks**:\n   - The film takes 5 weeks to complete.\n   \n   Total hours over 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost before any discount**:\n   - Jean charges $250 per hour.\n   \n   Total cost = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000\n\n4. **Apply the 10% discount**:\n   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.\n   \n   Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000\n\n5. **Calculate the final amount Jean paid after the discount**:\n   - Subtract the discount from the total cost.\n   \n   Final amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000\n\nTherefore, Jean paid a total of 27,000.']]
