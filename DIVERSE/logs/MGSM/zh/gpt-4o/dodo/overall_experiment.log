Problem 97: 当弗雷达把罐装番茄煮成番茄酱时，份量减少了一半。她使用的每个 16 盎司番茄罐头含有 3 颗番茄。弗雷达的最后一批番茄酱是 32 盎司的酱。弗雷达用了多少颗番茄？
Reasoning step: [["To solve the problem, let's go through the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Understanding the Reduction**: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into tomato sauce, the quantity is reduced by half. This means that the final tomato sauce is half the weight of the original canned tomatoes.\n\n2. **Final Sauce Quantity**: The final batch of tomato sauce is 32 ounces.\n\n3. **Original Tomato Quantity**: Since the sauce is half the weight of the original tomatoes, the original quantity of canned tomatoes must have been double the sauce quantity. Therefore, the original canned tomato quantity is:\n   \\[\n   32 \\, \\text{ounces} \\times 2 = 64 \\, \\text{ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.\n\n5. **Number of Cans Used**: To find out how many cans were used to achieve 64 ounces, we divide the total original quantity by the size of each can:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64 \\, \\text{ounces}}{16 \\, \\text{ounces per can}} = 4 \\, \\text{cans}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total Number of Tomatoes**: Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\, \\text{cans} \\times 3 \\, \\text{tomatoes per can} = 12 \\, \\text{tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes in total. The final answer is 12."]]

Reasoning step: [["To determine how many bags of wheat the merchant sold, let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bags of wheat.\n   - The cost price per bag is $20.\n   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.\n   - The selling price per bag is $30.\n   - The total profit is $400.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - The cost of purchasing \\( x \\) bags is \\( 20x \\) dollars.\n   - The cost of transporting \\( x \\) bags is \\( 2x \\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for \\( x \\) bags is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total revenue:**\n   - The selling price per bag is $30.\n   - Thus, the total revenue from selling \\( x \\) bags is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Revenue} = 30x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set up the profit equation:**\n   - Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Cost.\n   - We know the profit is $400, so:\n     \\[\n     30x - 22x = 400\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     8x = 400\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat.

Problem 221: 一个水箱装有 120 升水。席琳用水箱里的 90 升水给她的小花园浇水。她之后收集到剩余水量两倍的雨水。现在水箱里有多少升水？
Reasoning step: [['To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Amount of Water:** The water tank initially has 120 liters of water.\n\n2. **Water Used:** Celine uses 90 liters of water to water her garden. We subtract this amount from the initial amount to find the remaining water in the tank:\n   \\[\n   120 - 90 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 liters of water remain in the tank.\n\n3. **Rainwater Collected:** Celine collects rainwater that is twice the remaining amount of water in the tank. Since the remaining water is 30 liters, the amount of rainwater collected is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 30 = 60\n   \\]\n   Thus, 60 liters of rainwater is collected.\n\n4. **Final Amount of Water:** To find the current amount of water in the tank, add the rainwater collected to the remaining water:\n   \\[\n   30 + 60 = 90\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters. The final answer is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).']]

Reasoning step: [['To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Current Number of Pen Pals**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and is no longer pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he currently has:\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ pen pals}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Letters Received and Sent**: Each pen pal sends Mike 2 letters per week. Since Mike has 3 pen pals, he receives:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ letters per week}\n   \\]\n   Mike responds to each letter, so he also sends 6 letters per week.\n\n3. **Total Letters Written by Mike**: Since Mike writes a response to each letter he receives, he writes:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ letters per week}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pages per Letter**: Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike writes:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ pages per week}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Time to Write Each Page**: Mike takes 6 minutes to write one page.
