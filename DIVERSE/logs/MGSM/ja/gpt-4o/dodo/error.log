Problem 12: カルロスはレモンの木を植えようとしています。レモンの木は植えるのに90ドルかかります。毎年7個のレモンがなり、1つあたり1.5ドルで売れます。木に水をやり肥料を与えるのに1年間で3ドルかかります。カルロスがレモンの木で収益を得るようになるには何年かかりますか？
Reasoning step: [['To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the costs and revenues associated with the tree and find out when the revenues surpass the costs.\n\n1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.\n\n2. **Annual Revenue**: \n   - The tree produces 7 lemons per year.\n   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.\n   - Annual revenue from selling lemons = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.\n\n3. **Annual Cost**: \n   - The annual cost for watering and fertilizing the tree is $3.\n\n4. **Net Annual Profit**:\n   - Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost\n   - Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5/year.\n\n5. **Break-even Point**:\n   - To find out when Carlos will break even, we need to calculate how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.\n   - Let \\( n \\) be the number of years it takes to break even.\n   - Total net profit after \\( n \\) years = \\( n \\times $7.5 \\).\n   - Set the total net profit equal to the initial cost: \\( n \\times $7.5 = $90 \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( n \\)**:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree. The final answer is 12.']]

Problem 111: ジュリアのボートが、湖を運転中に水漏れを起こした。ボートは彼女が岸辺に向かい10フィートこぐたびに、2リットルの水が入っか。岸辺は64秒先だった。ジュリアが岸辺にたどり着くまでに、どれだけの水がボートに入ったか？
Reasoning step: [["To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: \n   - Julia's boat is leaking while she is rowing towards the shore.\n   - For every 10 feet she rows, 2 liters of water enter the boat.\n   - The shore is 64 seconds away.\n\n2. **Determine Rowing Speed**:\n   - To find out how much water enters by the time she reaches the shore, we need to know how many feet she rows in 64 seconds.\n   - Let's assume her rowing speed is constant. However, the problem doesn't provide a direct speed in feet per second or per minute, so we'll need to make an assumption or deduce it from given information.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Distance**:\n   - The problem doesn't give the speed in feet per second but mentions the shore is 64 seconds away. \n   - Without speed, it's challenging to calculate the exact distance, but the key information is how much water enters per 10 feet, not the actual distance in feet.\n   - Assuming she rows at a speed of \\( x \\) feet per second, in 64 seconds, she would row \\( 64x \\) feet.\n\n4. **Determine Water Intake Frequency**:\n   - Every 10 feet, 2 liters of water enter the boat.\n   - Thus, for every 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Water Intake**:\n   - To find out how much water enters by the time she reaches the shore:\n     - If she rows \\( 64x \\) feet in 64 seconds, then the number of 10-feet segments she rows is \\( \\frac{64x}{10} \\).\n     - Therefore, the total amount of water in liters that enters the boat is \\( \\frac{64x}{10} \\times 2 \\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Simplify the expression: \\( \\frac{64x}{10} \\times 2 = \\frac{128x}{10} = 12.8x \\).\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of \\( x \\) (feet per second), the answer is expressed in terms of \\( x \\). However, the final numerical answer depends on the rowing speed \\( x \\), which isn't provided explicitly in the problem. If \\( x \\) were provided, we could substitute it to find the exact liters of water. \n\nBut, to follow the problem's constraint of providing a final number without units, we assume there's an interpretation or further instruction missing in the problem.

Problem 205: ブリンリーはバート先生の数学の授業を受けています。バート先生はセメスターごとに6回テストを行います。彼は、各セメスターで最も低いスコアを、平均点から取り除くことを生徒に許可しています。ブリンリーがもし、最初の5回のテストで89、71、92、100そして86点を取ったら、彼女が平均で93点を取るには、6回目のテストで何点取る必要がありますか？
Reasoning step: [['To determine the score Brinley needs on her 6th test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Required for the Average:**\n\n   Since the average (mean) is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores, we can express it as follows for 6 tests:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of scores}}{\\text{Number of tests}}\n   \\]\n\n   Given that Brinley wants an average of 93 across 6 tests, the equation becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   93 = \\frac{\\text{Sum of scores}}{6}\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total sum of scores required is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of scores} = 93 \\times 6 = 558\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Current Total from the First 5 Tests:**\n\n   Add up the scores from the first 5 tests:\n\n   \\[\n   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\n   \\]\n\n3. **Consider Dropping the Lowest Score:**\n\n   Brinley is allowed to drop the lowest score among the 6 tests. Currently, her lowest score from the first 5 tests is 71. Dropping this score, the sum of her top 4 scores is:\n\n   \\[\n   89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Score Needed on the 6th Test:**\n\n   To achieve the target total of 558 (after dropping the lowest score), we need to include the 6th score. The equation becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   367 + \\text{6th score} = 558\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for the 6th score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{6th score} = 558 - 367 = 191\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Brinley needs to score **191** on her 6th test to achieve an average of 93, after dropping her lowest score.']]

Problem 209: 20ダースのカップは、$6000で売られている半ダースの皿の総額よりも、$1200安いです。それぞれのカップを購入する際の総額を計算しなさい。
Reasoning step: [['To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the problem:**\n   - We are given that 20 dozen cups are $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold for $6000.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**\n   - Half a dozen means 6 plates.\n   - The total cost of 6 plates is given as $6000.\n\n3. **Determine the cost difference:**\n   - The cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of the plates.\n   - Therefore, the cost of 20 dozen cups = $6000 - $1200.\n\n4. **Compute the cost of 20 dozen cups:**\n   - $6000 - $1200 = $4800.\n\n5. **Determine the total cost for each cup:**\n   - 1 dozen equals 12 cups.\n   - Therefore, 20 dozen cups = 20 × 12 = 240 cups.\n\n6. **Calculate the cost per cup:**\n   - Total cost for 240 cups is $4800.\n   - To find the cost per cup, divide the total cost by the number of cups: $4800 ÷ 240.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - $4800 ÷ 240 = $20 per cup.\n\nTherefore, the cost of purchasing each cup is 20.']]
